Compared with booking hotels on one’s own, finding accommodations on airbnb has now become a more and more popular option for people during vacations and road trips. Since review rating scores underlie guests’ overall evaluation, influenced by many aspects such as cleanliness, communication and location, they play very important roles as guidelines for people to choose certain accommodations during certain dates. Particularly, we are highly interested in airbnb’s performance in New York City. Consequently, we want to find out how different factors and their combinations affect customers' review scores ratings by analyzing related datasets downloaded from the official website.

We grab the data from the airbnb website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and download the related csv files for New York City. Then we choose review scores rating as the label to predict. Right now, We have 73 columns in one csv file and 6 columns in the other csv file. First, we will eliminate useless rows and columns by data preprocessing. Second, we may employ text mining and mapping to conduct exploratory analysis about the key words among texts such as titles on Airbnb and the distribution of Airbnb facilities of New York city. Third, we might do feature engineering to find important features and get rid of non-important ones. Finally, machine learning techniques are expected to be used to simulate the rating scores and make reasonable predictions and the specific methods would be chosen based on observations of wrangled data such as plots. 

It is plausible that we will add other related datasets or change former datasets in the future when other factors we assume necessary are detected during the simulation process.
